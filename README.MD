# Description
A level editor of JadeWare's Android [https://jadegame.com/games/android/], which is my favorite game when I was a kid.
This project is built when I found some map errors in game.
So I built up this project to fix this errors.
You can also customize your level using it.

Install NodeJS at [https://nodejs.org/]
```bash
npm install 
```
# Start

npm start
```
